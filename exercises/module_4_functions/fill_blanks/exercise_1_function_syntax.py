# --- Exercise A: Defining a Function ---
# {{CONTEXT_EXERCISE_1_NARRATIVE}}
#
# Complete the function definition by filling in the blanks.

def exercise_a():
    # FILL IN THE BLANKS
    #
    # Complete the function definition below.
    # A function starts with a keyword, has a name, parentheses, and a colon.

    # ___ greet():               # Hint: What keyword starts a function definition?
    #     print("Hello from {{school}}!")

    # After filling in, uncomment and test:
    # greet()

    pass


# --- Exercise B: Function Body Indentation ---
# {{CONTEXT_EXERCISE_2_NARRATIVE}}
#
# The function body must be indented inside the function.

def exercise_b():
    # FILL IN THE BLANKS
    #
    # Complete the function. Remember: code inside a function must be indented.

    # def announce():
    #     ___("{{hero}} has arrived!")        # Hint: What function displays text?
    #     ___("Welcome to {{location}}!")    # Hint: Same function again

    # After filling in, uncomment and test:
    # announce()

    pass


# --- Exercise C: Calling a Function ---
# {{CONTEXT_EXERCISE_3_NARRATIVE}}
#
# To run a function, you must call it with parentheses.

def exercise_c():
    # FILL IN THE BLANKS
    #
    # Complete the code to define and call a function.

    # def show_info():
    #     print("Name: {{heroine}}")
    #     print("Location: {{school}}")

    # Now call the function:
    # ___()                                   # Hint: Use the function's name with ()

    pass


# --- Exercise D: Multiple Functions ---
# {{CONTEXT_EXERCISE_4_NARRATIVE}}
#
# You can define and call multiple functions.

def exercise_d():
    # FILL IN THE BLANKS
    #
    # Fill in the missing keywords and function calls.

    # ___ first_message():                    # Hint: Keyword to start a function
    #     print("Starting the journey...")

    # ___ second_message():                   # Hint: Same keyword
    #     print("{{hero}} is ready!")

    # Call both functions:
    # ___()                                   # Hint: Call first_message
    # ___()                                   # Hint: Call second_message

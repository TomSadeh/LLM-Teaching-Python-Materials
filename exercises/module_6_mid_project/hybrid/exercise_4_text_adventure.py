# Project: Text Adventure
# ============================================================
# Build a text adventure where the player explores {{school}}.
#
# Your game should:
# - Track player state (name, health, inventory, location)
# - Have multiple locations to explore
# - Allow picking up and using items
# - Include random events or encounters
# - Have win and lose conditions
#
# ✏️ YOUR CODE HERE ✏️
# Design your own functions to accomplish the above goals.
# Think about how to structure your game world and player actions.

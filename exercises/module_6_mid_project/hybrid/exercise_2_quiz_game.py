# Project: Quiz Game
# ============================================================
# Build a quiz game with multiple choice questions.
#
# Your game should:
# - Store questions with correct and wrong answers
# - Display questions with shuffled answer choices
# - Track the player's score
# - Show results at the end
# - Offer to play again
#
# ✏️ YOUR CODE HERE ✏️
# Design your own functions to accomplish the above goals.
# Think about how to structure your question data and game flow.

    print("{{greeting}}")
    print("Welcome to the {{school}} Quiz!")
    print()

    # ✏️ YOUR CODE HERE ✏️

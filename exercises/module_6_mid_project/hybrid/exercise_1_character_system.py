# ============================================================
# Project: Character Profile System
# ============================================================
# Build a system to create, display, and manage character profiles.
#
# Your system should:
# - Store character data (name, health, ability, level) in lists
# - Display character information in a formatted way
# - Allow modifications (level up, take damage, heal)
# - Provide an interactive menu for users
#
# ✏️ YOUR CODE HERE ✏️
# Design your own functions to accomplish the above goals.
# Think about what operations you need and how to organize them.


def main():
    print("{{greeting}}")
    print("Welcome to the {{school}} Character Manager!")
    print()

    # ✏️ YOUR CODE HERE ✏️
    # Build your character management system

    print()
    print("{{exclamation}} Goodbye!")

# ✏️ YOUR CODE HERE ✏️
# Create functions for data persistence
#
# You'll need:
# - A way to save all entities to a JSON file
# - A way to load entities back (reconstructing the right class types)
# - Graceful handling when the file doesn't exist yet


if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Test your storage functions

# ✏️ YOUR CODE HERE ✏️
# Create your entity class hierarchy
#
# You'll need:
# - A base class that all entities share (name, type, creation date)
# - At least 2 specialized subclasses with unique attributes
# - A way to display each entity nicely (hint: __str__)
# - A way to convert entities to dicts for JSON storage


if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Test your classes
    pass

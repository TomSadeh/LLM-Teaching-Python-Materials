## Overview

This is your coding playground! There are no specific exercises or "right answers" here. Use this space to:

- Experiment with ideas
- Try things you're curious about
- Combine concepts you've learned
- Make mistakes and learn from them

---

## Prerequisites

None required! Jump in at any level:

- [ ] Brand new? Try simple `print()` statements
- [ ] Know some basics? Experiment with variables and loops
- [ ] More advanced? Build a mini-project

---

## Inspiration Prompts

Not sure what to try? Here are some ideas:

### For Beginners

1. **Tell a story** - Use `print()` to write a short story about {{hero}} and {{heroine}}
2. **Mad libs** - Create variables for names and places, then combine them into a funny sentence
3. **Calculator** - Make a simple calculator that adds two numbers

### For Intermediate

1. **Quiz game** - Ask questions about {{school}} and check if answers are correct
2. **Drawing** - Use turtle to draw {{creature}} or create a pattern
3. **List adventure** - Create a list of items {{hero}} might carry on a quest

### For Advanced

1. **Text adventure** - Build a simple game where choices lead to different outcomes
2. **Character creator** - Use dictionaries to store character stats
3. **Your own idea** - What have you always wanted to build?

---

## Tips for Exploration

### Start Small
Begin with something simple. You can always add more!

```python
# Start here
print("Hello, {{school}}!")

# Then try adding a variable
character_name = "{{hero}}"
print(f"Welcome, {character_name}!")

# Then maybe a loop...
for i in range(3):
    print(f"{character_name} casts {{spell1}}!")
```

### It's OK to Make Mistakes
Errors are learning opportunities! When you see an error:
1. Read the message - it usually tells you what's wrong
2. Check the line number
3. Look for typos or missing punctuation

### Ask for Help
If you get stuck, just ask! Describe what you're trying to do and what's happening.

## Challenge Yourself

When you're ready for more:

- **Combine two concepts** - Can you use a loop inside a function?
- **Add user input** - Let the user make choices
- **Make it yours** - Change the example to match your interests

## Notes for the LLM Teacher

This is an open-ended practice session. Key guidance:

- **Follow the student's lead** - Let them explore what interests them
- **Encourage experimentation** - There's no wrong direction here
- **Celebrate creativity** - Praise original ideas, not just correct syntax
- **Scaffold gently** - If they're stuck, offer the smallest hint that gets them unstuck
- **Connect to prior learning** - Reference concepts from modules they've completed
- **Keep it fun** - This is play time, not test time

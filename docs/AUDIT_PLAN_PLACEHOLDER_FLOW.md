# Audit Plan: Placeholder Flow and Logical Progression

Assessment of narrative coherence and learning progression through placeholder usage.

---

## Overview

**Goal:** Evaluate how placeholders create (or fail to create) narrative flow and support learning progression.

**Scope:** All 145 exercises across 10 modules

**Output:** Scoring and observations only, no redesigns or specific fixes

---

## Evaluation Framework

### Dimension 1: Narrative Coherence

**Question:** Do the placeholders tell a coherent story within the module?

**Rating Scale (0-3):**
- **0** - No narrative (random/absent placeholders)
- **1** - Weak narrative (some connection but disjointed)
- **2** - Clear narrative (exercises flow as a story)
- **3** - Strong narrative (engaging mini-adventure)

**Evaluation Method:**
1. Read all exercises in module order
2. Track which placeholders appear and when
3. Assess if there's a beginning, middle, end
4. Note disconnects or random placeholder changes

---

### Dimension 2: Concept Progression

**Question:** Do exercises build on each other programmatically?

**Rating Scale (0-3):**
- **0** - Disconnected (no relationship between exercises)
- **1** - Loose connection (same topic, different contexts)
- **2** - Clear progression (each adds one new element)
- **3** - Scaffolded (perfect learning staircase)

**Evaluation Method:**
1. Map concepts introduced per exercise
2. Check if new concepts build on previous
3. Verify difficulty increases gradually
4. Note conceptual jumps or redundancy

---

### Dimension 3: Theme Integration

**Question:** Do placeholders enhance or distract from learning?

**Rating Scale (0-3):**
- **0** - Breaks immersion (forced or inappropriate)
- **1** - Neutral (present but not meaningful)
- **2** - Supports theme (feels natural)
- **3** - Enhances learning (theme aids understanding)

**Evaluation Method:**
1. Check if placeholders fit exercise context
2. Assess if fantasy elements obscure or clarify concepts
3. Verify consistency within exercise
4. Note where theme distracts vs. supports

## Audit Process

### Week 1: Module Scoring

**Days 1-2:** Score modules 0-4
- Read all exercises in sequence
- Apply 3-dimension scoring
- Document observations

**Days 3-4:** Score modules 5-9
- Continue scoring process
- Note patterns across modules

**Day 5:** Compile scores
- Create scoring matrix
- Identify high/low scoring modules

**Deliverable:** Initial scoring matrix

---

### Week 2: Detailed Analysis

**Days 1-3:** Deep dive on low-scoring modules (<6/9)
- Document specific disconnects
- Map placeholder usage patterns
- Note where progression breaks

**Days 4-5:** Review high-scoring modules (≥6/9)
- Document what works well
- Extract successful patterns
- Identify best practices

**Deliverable:** Detailed analysis per module

---

### Week 3: Pattern Identification

**Days 1-2:** Cross-module analysis
- Identify common issues
- Note successful patterns
- Check inter-module coherence

**Days 3-4:** Exercise type patterns
- Group by exercise type (write_code, etc.)
- See if certain types have better flow
- Document type-specific observations

**Day 5:** Placeholder variable analysis
- Which placeholders correlate with better flow?
- Are certain variables overused/underused?
- Document variable-level patterns

**Deliverable:** Pattern analysis report

---

### Week 4: Documentation

**Days 1-3:** Compile all findings
- Organize by module
- Create summary tables
- Document observations

**Days 4-5:** Final report
- High-level summary
- Module-by-module details
- Patterns and observations

**Deliverable:** Final audit report

---

## Documentation Format

### Per-Module Report

```
Module: module_X_topic
Total Exercises: N

Scores:
- Narrative Coherence: X/3
- Concept Progression: Y/3
- Theme Integration: Z/3
- Total: XX/9

Narrative Observations:
[What story, if any, do the placeholders tell?]
[Where does narrative break?]
[Which exercises feel disconnected?]

Progression Observations:
[How do concepts build?]
[Are there jumps or redundancy?]
[Does difficulty increase smoothly?]

Integration Observations:
[Do placeholders fit contexts?]
[Where does theme help/hurt?]
[Is usage consistent?]

Placeholder Usage:
Most frequent: [list top 3-5]
Least frequent: [list bottom 3-5]
Pattern: [describe overall pattern]
```

## Scoring Matrix Template

| Module | Exercises | Narrative | Progression | Integration | Total | Priority |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-------------|-------------|-------|----------|
| module_0 | 23 | ?/3 | ?/3 | ?/3 | ?/9 | TBD |
| module_1 | 11 | ?/3 | ?/3 | ?/3 | ?/9 | TBD |
| module_2 | 10 | ?/3 | ?/3 | ?/3 | ?/9 | TBD |
| module_3 | 10 | ?/3 | ?/3 | ?/3 | ?/9 | TBD |
| module_4 | 9 | ?/3 | ?/3 | ?/3 | ?/9 | TBD |
| module_5 | 9 | ?/3 | ?/3 | ?/3 | ?/9 | TBD |
| module_6 | 3 | ?/3 | ?/3 | ?/3 | ?/9 | TBD |
| module_7 | 9 | ?/3 | ?/3 | ?/3 | ?/9 | TBD |
| module_8 | 9 | ?/3 | ?/3 | ?/3 | ?/9 | TBD |
| module_9 | 9 | ?/3 | ?/3 | ?/3 | ?/9 | TBD |

**Priority Interpretation:**
- Score ≥7: LOW priority (working well)
- Score 4-6: MEDIUM priority (needs improvement)
- Score <4: HIGH priority (significant issues)

## Documentation Structure

Create in `docs/audits/placeholder_flow/`:

1. **scoring_matrix.md** - All module scores
2. **module_reports/** - Directory with per-module detailed reports
   - `module_0_basics.md`
   - `module_1_turtle_loops.md`
   - ...etc.
3. **pattern_analysis.md** - Cross-module patterns
4. **summary.md** - High-level findings

---

## Success Criteria

Audit is complete when:
- [ ] All 10 modules scored on 3 dimensions
- [ ] Detailed observations documented per module
- [ ] Scoring matrix complete
- [ ] Pattern analysis conducted
- [ ] Cross-module coherence checked
- [ ] Findings documented without specific fixes

---

## Objectivity Guidelines

To maintain audit objectivity:
- **DO:** Observe and document what exists
- **DO:** Score based on defined criteria
- **DO:** Note patterns and issues
- **DO NOT:** Propose specific exercise changes
- **DO NOT:** Suggest placeholder additions/removals
- **DO NOT:** Design narrative arcs
- **DO NOT:** Create implementation plans

Save recommendations for post-audit discussion.

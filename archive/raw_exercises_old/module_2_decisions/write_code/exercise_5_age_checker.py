def check_age(age):
    # ✏️ YOUR CODE HERE ✏️
    # Print what the person can do based on their age:
    # - Under 13: "You can watch kids movies!"
    # - 13-15: "You can watch PG-13 movies!"
    # - 16-17: "You can drive (with a permit)!"
    # - 18 and up: "You can vote and watch any movie!"
    #
    # Hint: Use if/elif/else
    # Hint: You can check ranges like: if age >= 13 and age <= 15
    pass

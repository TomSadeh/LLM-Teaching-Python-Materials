# Exercise 13: FizzBuzz Challenge!
#
# This is a famous programming challenge!
#
# Print numbers from 1 to 30, BUT:
# - If the number is divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead
# - If the number is divisible by 5, print "Buzz" instead
# - If the number is divisible by BOTH 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz"
#
# Expected output starts like:
# 1
# 2
# Fizz
# 4
# Buzz
# Fizz
# 7
# 8
# Fizz
# Buzz
# 11
# Fizz
# 13
# 14
# FizzBuzz
# 16
# ...


def fizzbuzz():
    # ✏️ YOUR CODE HERE
    # Hint: check divisible by both first!
    # Use: if number % 3 == 0 (divisible by 3)
    pass


def main():
    print("=== FizzBuzz 1-30 ===")
    fizzbuzz()


main()

# Exercise 1: Password Checker - Gryffindor Common Room


def check_password():
    # ✏️ YOUR CODE HERE ✏️
    # The Fat Lady guards the entrance to Gryffindor Tower!
    # 1. Ask the user for the password using input()
    # 2. Check if it equals "Caput Draconis" (the first password in the books!)
    # 3. If yes - print "The portrait swings open. Welcome to Gryffindor!"
    # 4. If no - print "The Fat Lady shakes her head. Wrong password!"
    pass

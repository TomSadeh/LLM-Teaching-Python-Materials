# Exercise 9: Fantasy Book Adventure!

def start_adventure():
    # ✏️ YOUR CODE HERE ✏️
    # Create a text adventure set in one of your favorite book worlds!
    #
    # Pick a setting:
    # - Hogwarts (find a magical object, escape a creature)
    # - Camp Half-Blood (go on a quest, meet a god)
    # - The Hunger Games arena (survive, find allies)
    # - The Lost Cities (discover a secret, use your abilities)
    #
    # The structure:
    # 1. Print a story introduction (set the scene!)
    # 2. Give the player choices (1, 2, etc.)
    # 3. Use if/elif/else to handle their choice
    # 4. Each choice leads to a new situation with more choices
    # 5. End with different outcomes based on their path
    #
    # Example start (Hogwarts):
    # "You're wandering the halls of Hogwarts at night..."
    # "You hear footsteps! What do you do?"
    # "1. Hide behind a statue"
    # "2. Use the Invisibility Cloak"
    # "3. Run for it!"
    #
    # Example start (Keeper of the Lost Cities):
    # "You're at Foxfire Academy when the Neverseen attacks!"
    # "1. Use your telepathy to warn everyone"
    # "2. Find Keefe and the others"
    # "3. Light leap to safety"
    #
    # Make it at least 2 choices deep!

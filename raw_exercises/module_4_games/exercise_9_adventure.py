# Exercise 9: Fantasy Book Adventure!

def start_adventure():
    # ✏️ YOUR CODE HERE ✏️
    # Create a text adventure set in one of your favorite book worlds!
    #
    # Pick a setting:
    # - {{school}} (find a magical object, escape a creature)
    # - {{school}} (go on a quest, meet a god)
    # - The Hunger Games arena (survive, find allies)
    # - {{location}} (discover a secret, use your abilities)
    #
    # The structure:
    # 1. Print a story introduction (set the scene!)
    # 2. Give the player choices (1, 2, etc.)
    # 3. Use if/elif/else to handle their choice
    # 4. Each choice leads to a new situation with more choices
    # 5. End with different outcomes based on their path
    #
    # Example start ({{school}}):
    # "You're wandering the halls of {{school}} at night..."
    # "You hear footsteps! What do you do?"
    # "1. Hide behind a statue"
    # "2. Use the {{item}}"
    # "3. Run for it!"
    #
    # Example start ({{school}} series):
    # "You're at {{school}} when {{villain}} attacks!"
    # "1. Use your {{spell1}} to warn everyone"
    # "2. Find {{hero}} and the others"
    # "3. Use {{spell2}} to {{exclamation}} to safety"
    #
    # Make it at least 2 choices deep!

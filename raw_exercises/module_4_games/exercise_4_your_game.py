# Exercise 4: Create Your Own Game!

import random


# ✏️ CREATE YOUR OWN GAME! ✏️
#
# Ideas:
# - Higher/Lower: guess if next number is higher or lower
# - Word Scramble: unscramble random letters to make a word
# - Trivia: quiz game with score tracking
# - Adventure: text-based choices ("go left" or "go right")
# - Coin Flip: bet on heads or tails
# - Math Quiz: random math problems to solve
#
# Your game should have:
# 1. A clear goal for the player
# 2. Some kind of loop (multiple rounds or attempts)
# 3. A way to win or lose
# 4. Score tracking or lives
# 5. Fun messages!
#
# Start with these functions and modify as needed:


def setup_game():
    # Set up any starting values
    pass


def play_round():
    # One round of your game
    pass


def show_result(score):
    # Show final results
    print("Final score:", score)


def main():
    print("🎮 My Awesome Game 🎮")
    print("=====================")

    # Your game loop here!


main()

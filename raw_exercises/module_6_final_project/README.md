## Project Requirements

Your project should include:

1. **At least 3 functions** you wrote yourself
2. **User input** - the program asks for something
3. **Decisions** - if/else to do different things
4. **A loop** - something that repeats
5. **Lists** - store multiple items
6. **Clear output** - tell the user what's happening

## Tips for Success

1. **Start simple** - get a basic version working first
2. **Test often** - run your code after small changes
3. **Add features** - once basics work, add more!
4. **Have fun** - this is YOUR project!

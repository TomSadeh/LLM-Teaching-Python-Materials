# Exercise 2: Variables


def exercise_a():
    # ✏️ Create a variable called 'hero' with your favorite book character
    # (like "Sophie Foster", "Katniss", "Percy", or "Hermione")
    # Then print: "My favorite hero is [hero]!"

    pass


def exercise_b():
    # ✏️ Create two variables:
    # character = a character from Harry Potter, Percy Jackson,
    #             Hunger Games, or Keeper of the Lost Cities
    # book = which book/series they're from
    # Print both using print()

    pass


def exercise_c():
    # ✏️ Create these variables and print them all:
    # school = a magical school (like "Hogwarts" or "Foxfire Academy")
    # house = a house or group (like "Gryffindor" or "Team Valiant")
    # spell = an ability or spell (like "Expecto Patronum" or "Teleporting")

    pass


def exercise_d():
    # ✏️ Create a variable 'quote' with a quote from your favorite book
    # Print it 3 times (use the variable 3 times!)
    # Example: "May the odds be ever in your favor"

    pass


def exercise_e():
    # ✏️ Fix this code! It has errors:
    # heroName = Sophie Foster
    # print(heroname)

    pass

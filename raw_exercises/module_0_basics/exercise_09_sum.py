# Exercise 9: Accumulating Values in Loops


def exercise_a():
    # ✏️ Calculate the sum of numbers 1 to 5 (should be 15)
    # Use a loop and a variable to keep track of the sum
    # total = 0
    # for i in range(...):
    #     total = total + i
    pass


def exercise_b():
    # ✏️ Calculate the sum of numbers 1 to 100
    # Print the result (should be 5050)
    pass


def exercise_c():
    # ✏️ Calculate the sum of even numbers from 2 to 20
    pass


def exercise_d():
    # ✏️ Ask the user for a number n
    # Calculate and print the sum of 1 to n
    pass


def exercise_e():
    # ✏️ Calculate the factorial of 5 (5! = 5*4*3*2*1 = 120)
    # Use a loop!
    # Start with result = 1, then multiply by each number
    pass


def exercise_f():
    # ✏️ Ask user for a number n
    # Calculate factorial of n (n!)
    pass


def exercise_g():
    # ✏️ Count how many numbers from 1 to 100 are divisible by 7
    # Hint: if number % 7 == 0, it's divisible by 7
    pass


def exercise_h():
    # ✏️ Ask the user to enter 5 numbers (one at a time)
    # Calculate and print:
    # - The sum of all numbers
    # - The average

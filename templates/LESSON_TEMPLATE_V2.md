# Lesson: [Module Name] - Part [X]: [Topic Title]

> **Module**: module_X_topic
> **Part**: X of Y
> **Difficulty**: 1-5
> **Duration**: 3-5 minutes

---

## Prerequisites

### Concepts
- [ ] Concept from previous part
- [ ] Concept from previous part

### Exercises Completed
- [ ] `type/exercise_name` (Part X)

---

## Learning Objective

- **One specific, measurable objective**

---

## Key Concepts

| Concept | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| `concept_1` | Simple explanation |
| `concept_2` | Use analogies when helpful |

---

## Lesson Flow

### Phase 1: OBSERVE
Student studies existing code before writing.

**Exercise**: `output_prediction/exercise_X` or `match_output/exercise_X`

Guide to: read code → predict output → run to verify → discuss surprises

### Phase 2: PRACTICE
Student completes scaffolded code.

**Exercise**: `fill_blanks/exercise_X` or `complete_function/exercise_X`

### Phase 3: CREATE
Student writes code independently.

**Exercise**: `write_code/exercise_X`

### Phase 4: DEBUG (optional)
Student identifies and fixes errors.

**Exercise**: `decode_error/exercise_X` or `bug_hunt/exercise_X`

## Exercise Sequence

| Order | Exercise | Type | Phase |
|-------|----------|------|-------|
| 1 | `type/exercise_name` | Predict | OBSERVE |
| 2 | `type/exercise_name` | Fill | PRACTICE |
| 3 | `type/exercise_name` | Write | CREATE |
| 4 | `type/exercise_name` | Debug | DEBUG |

---

## Checkpoint

**Ask**: [Question testing the learning objective]

**Expected**: [What correct understanding looks like]

---

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Example | Hint Strategy |
|---------|---------|---------------|
| [Error type] | `code` | Point to specific element, don't give answer |

---

## If Student Struggles

| Signal | Response |
|--------|----------|
| Conceptual confusion | Return to OBSERVE with simpler example |
| Syntax errors | Focus on one error, read message together |
| Frustration | Break into smaller step, acknowledge difficulty |
| Wants answer | Redirect to example or previous exercise |

---

## Capstone (if applicable)

**Hybrid**: `hybrid/exercise_X`

Assign after main exercises to consolidate learning.

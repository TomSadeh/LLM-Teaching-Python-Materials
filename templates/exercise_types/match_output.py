# TEMPLATE: Match the Output
# =============================================================================
#
# PURPOSE: Students match code snippets to their outputs.
# SKILL: Pattern recognition, quick code reading
#
# STRUCTURE:
#   - Present N code snippets (labeled snippet_1, snippet_2, etc.)
#   - Present N possible outputs (labeled OUTPUT A, B, C, etc.)
#   - Student matches each snippet to its output
#   - Optional: explain reasoning
#
# GUIDELINES:
#   - Keep snippets SHORT (3-8 lines each)
#   - Snippets should look SIMILAR but behave DIFFERENTLY
#   - Outputs should be distinct enough to match unambiguously
#   - Good for testing: operator differences, method behaviors,
#     loop variations, indexing differences
#
# DIFFICULTY SCALING:
#   - Easy: Obviously different code, clearly different outputs
#   - Medium: Similar-looking code, subtle output differences
#   - Hard: Nearly identical code, requires deep understanding
#
# =============================================================================

# Exercise N: Match the Output - [TOPIC]
#
# Match each code snippet with its correct output.
# Don't run the code - use your mental execution skills!
#
# Theme: [THEMED CONTEXT USING {{placeholders}}]


# ============================================================
# CODE SNIPPETS - Study these carefully
# ============================================================

def snippet_1():
    # [SHORT CODE THAT PRODUCES OUTPUT]

def snippet_2():
    # [SIMILAR BUT DIFFERENT CODE]
    pass


def snippet_3():
    # [ANOTHER VARIATION]
    pass


# [ADD MORE AS NEEDED]


# ============================================================
# POSSIBLE OUTPUTS - Which goes with which snippet?
# ============================================================

"""
OUTPUT A:
---------
[What one snippet would print]

OUTPUT B:
---------
[What another snippet would print]

OUTPUT C:
---------
[What another snippet would print]

[ADD MORE AS NEEDED - should match number of snippets]

# GOOD CONCEPTS FOR MATCHING EXERCISES:
# =============================================================================
#
# OPERATORS:
#   - / vs //
#   - + with strings vs numbers
#   - == vs = (in context)
#   - and vs or behavior
#
# STRING METHODS:
#   - split() vs split(" ")
#   - strip() vs replace()
#   - upper() vs capitalize()
#
# LIST OPERATIONS:
#   - append() vs extend()
#   - [0] vs [:1]
#   - pop() vs remove()
#
# LOOP VARIATIONS:
#   - range(5) vs range(1, 5) vs range(0, 5, 2)
#   - for x in list vs for i, x in enumerate(list)

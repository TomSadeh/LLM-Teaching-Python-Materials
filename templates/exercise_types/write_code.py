# =============================================================================
# TEMPLATE: Write Code
# =============================================================================
#
# PURPOSE: Students write code following instructions to solve tasks.
# SKILL: Core programming, applying concepts, problem-solving
#
# STRUCTURE:
#   - Clear task description with context
#   - Step-by-step instructions in comments
#   - Hints when helpful
#   - Pass placeholder for student code
#
# GUIDELINES:
#   - Each function should focus on ONE concept/task
#   - Use {{placeholders}} for themed content (REQUIRED - at least one per file)
#   - Progressive difficulty within the file
#   - Instructions should be unambiguous
#   - Include hints for non-obvious steps
#
# DIFFICULTY SCALING:
#   - Easy: Single concept, explicit instructions
#   - Medium: Combine 2-3 concepts, some inference required
#   - Hard: Integration, problem decomposition, minimal guidance
#

    # [Task description with themed elements]
    # Example: Create a variable called 'hero' with the value "{{hero}}"

    # Step 1: [First action to take]
    # Step 2: [Second action to take]
    #
    # Hint: [Helpful guidance if needed]

    # ✏️ YOUR CODE HERE ✏️
    #
    # [Most challenging task in the file]

    # [Instructions...]

#
# REMEMBER: Every exercise file must have at least ONE placeholder!

# =============================================================================
# INSTRUCTION PATTERNS:
# =============================================================================
#
# For variables:
#   "Create a variable called 'x' with the value ___"
#
# For printing:
#   "Print: [exact output format]"
#   "Display the result using an f-string"
#
# For input:
#   "Ask the user for their ___"
#   "Store the input in a variable called ___"
#
# For loops:
#   "Use a for loop to iterate over ___"
#   "Repeat N times using a loop"
#
# For conditions:
#   "If ___ is true, then ___"
#   "Check whether ___ and respond accordingly"
#
# For functions:
#   "Create a function called ___ that takes ___"
#   "Return the result instead of printing it"

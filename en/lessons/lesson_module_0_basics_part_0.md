## Topics to Cover

### 1. What is Programming
- Giving precise instructions to a computer
- Computers are literal, not smart - they do exactly what you say
- Analogy: recipe, game rules, or dance choreography (pick one based on student interests)

### 2. What is Python
- A programming language - way to write instructions computers understand
- Named after Monty Python comedy group, not the snake
- Known for readability

### 3. Mistakes are Learning
- Errors are normal and expected
- Even experienced programmers make mistakes daily
- Error messages are information, not failure

### 4. How We Work Together
- Hints and questions, not answers
- Experimentation encouraged
- No silly questions

## Common Misconceptions

| Misconception | Reality |
|---------------|---------|
| Programming requires math talent | Logic and step-by-step thinking matter more |
| Errors mean I'm bad at this | Errors are part of every programmer's day |
| I can break the computer | Wrong code produces error messages, nothing worse |
| I need to memorize everything | Looking things up is normal |

---

## Watch For

| Signal | Response |
|--------|----------|
| Nervous about making mistakes | Emphasize that errors are expected and helpful |
| Eager to start coding | Keep intro brief, move to Part 1 |
| Compares self to others | Everyone learns differently, focus on their progress |

---

## Transition to Part 1

Verify readiness, then move to first code.
